[DEPRECATED]

Description
===========

This template deploys a [Grafana](http://grafana.org) server pointed to [Rackspace](http://rackspace.com) Cloud Metrics as a backend.

Requirements
============
* An OpenStack username, password, and tenant id.
* [python-heatclient](https://github.com/openstack/python-heatclient)
`>= v0.2.8`:

```bash
pip install python-heatclient
```

We recommend installing the client within a [Python virtual
environment](http://www.virtualenv.org/).

Example Usage
=============
Here is an example of how to deploy this template using the
[python-heatclient](https://github.com/openstack/python-heatclient):

```
heat \
  --os-username <OS-USERNAME> \
  --os-password <OS-PASSWORD> \
  --os-tenant-id <TENANT-ID> \
  --os-auth-url https://identity.api.rackspacecloud.com/v2.0/ \
  stack-create mygrafanadashboard -f grafana.yaml \
  -P rax_tenant=$RAX_TENANT_ID \
  -P rax_username=$RAX_USER_NAME \
  -P rax_apikey=$RAX_API_KEY \
  -P host_name=$WHATEVER_URL_YOU_WANT
```

* For UK customers, use `https://lon.identity.api.rackspacecloud.com/v2.0/` as
the `--os-auth-url`.

Optionally, set environment variables to avoid needing to provide these
values every time a call is made:

```
export OS_USERNAME=<USERNAME>
export OS_PASSWORD=<PASSWORD>
export OS_TENANT_ID=<TENANT-ID>
export OS_AUTH_URL=<AUTH-URL>
```

Parameters
==========
Parameters can be replaced with your own values when standing up a stack. Use
the `-P` flag to specify a custom parameter.

* `rax_tenant`: The Rackspace tenant ID the grafana server will use.  This is the numeric id for the user, not the username.
* `rax_username`: The Rackspace username the grafana server will use.
* `rax_apikey`: The API key for the Rackspace user the grafana server will use.  You can find this by logging in to mycloud.rackspace.com and navigating to the 'Accounts Settings' page ([https://mycloud.rackspace.com/cloud/<rax_tenant>/account#settings](https://mycloud.rackspace.com/cloud/<rax_tenant>/account#settings))
* `host_name`: (optional) Domain to be used for the grafana sever. Note that you must set up this domain separately: the template does not register the domain for you.
* `apache_auth_user`: (optional) User name used to authenticate into Apache.  Default username: 'grafana'.
* `flavor` . Cloud Server flavor (size) to use. Default flavor: '2GB Standard Instance'.
* `es_version`. Elastsearch version to use.  Default Elasticsearch version: '1.3.4'.
* `gr_version`. Grafana version to use. Default Grafana version: '1.8.1'.

Outputs
=======
Once a stack comes online, use `heat output-list` to see all available outputs.
Use `heat output-show <OUTPUT NAME>` to get the value fo a specific output.

* `private_key`: SSH private that can be used to login as root to the servers.
* `public_ip`: IP of the server created with this deployment.
* `apache_auth_user`: basic http auth username (default: 'grafana').
* `apache_auth_password`: basic http auth password.


For multi-line values, the response will come in an escaped form. To get rid of
the escapes, use `echo -e '<STRING>' > file.txt`. For vim users, a substitution
can be done within a file using `%s/\\n/\r/g`.

Stack Details
=============
The application is deployed [Capistrano](http://capistranorb.com/)-style
in the home directory of the `rails` user in a directory based on the name of
the git repo.

Gems dependencies are installed by running a `bundle install --deployment` in
the application directory. This requires a Gemfile.lock in the application
repo.

Two rake tasks are run at deployment time: `rake db:migrate` followed by
`rake assets:precompile`. Additional rake tasks will be run if provided.

If you are using unicorn it must be declared in the application's Gemfile.

A unicorn.rb file is generated and placed in the application's config
directory along with a database.yml file configured to reference the
deployment's database server.
